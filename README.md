Description
 Data analysis project focused on hospital patient admissions, diseases, and treatment costs analysis.
 
**Problem Statement**

Hospitals generate large volumes of patient and treatment data every day. However, managing and analyzing this data effectively is a major challenge. Hospitals often struggle with:

1.Tracking treatment costs across different departments

2.Monitoring average patient stay duration

3.Measuring treatment outcomes such as recovery, readmissions, and critical cases

4.Allocating resources like beds, staff, and medicines efficiently

Without clear and timely insights, hospitals may face higher operational costs, inefficient use of resources, and reduced patient satisfaction.

** Aim of the Hospital**

1.The primary aim of this analysis is to help hospitals achieve the following goals:

2.Reduce patient readmissions and critical cases

3.Provide affordable and high-quality healthcare

4.Efficiently manage hospital resources (beds, staff, medicines)

5.Improve treatment outcomes and patient recovery rates

6.Enable data-driven decision-making for hospital management

**Project Objectives**

1.This project focuses on analyzing hospital data to generate actionable insights. The main objectives are:

2.Build an interactive dashboard to monitor treatment costs and patient outcomes

3.Analyze patient stay duration across different age groups and departments

4.Compare cost efficiency of various treatment types

5.Identify trends in patient admissions by month and age group

6.Provide insights to improve patient care while reducing overall costs

**Dataset Overview**

Total Records: 500 patients

Time Period: January 2024 – March 2024

**Key Columns:**
Patient ID , Age , Gender , Department , Treatment Type , Treatment Cost , Admission Date , Discharge Date , Treatment Outcome , Data Processing:

A new column Stay_Duration was created by calculating the number of days between admission and discharge dates.

**Dashboard KPIs & Key Insights**

Average Patient Stay Duration: 8 days
 
Most Admitted Age Group: Elderly patients

Most Common Treatment Type: Surgery

Average Treatment Cost: ₹101.47K

Highest Cost Department: Cardiology

Total Cost in Cardiology Department: ₹10.83M

**Key Insights**
1.Elderly patients have the highest average stay duration compared to other age groups

2.Surgery has the highest treatment cost among all treatment types

3.Surgical procedures contribute the highest total cost to the hospital

4.The average stay duration of a patient is 8 days

5.Elderly patients show the highest number of readmissions and critical outcomes

6.The Orthopedics department records the longest average stay duration.

**Tools & Technologies Used**

SQL – Data querying and aggregation

Power BI – Dashboard creation and visualization

**Recommendations**

1.Provide regular monitoring and timely care for elderly patients to improve recovery speed and reduce stay duration, helping free beds for other patients

2.Optimize and reduce surgery-related costs where possible to make treatments more affordable and attract more patients

3.Reduce readmission rates by ensuring proper follow-up care, discharge instructions, and patient education

4.Increase the number of doctors and staff in the Orthopedics department to manage workload effectively and shorten patient stay duration

5.Maintain high standards of hospital cleanliness and hygiene, as a clean environment supports faster patient recovery and better overall outcomes
